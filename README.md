Created this repo to learn to debug.

Still not working as expected. 

The file send_reminders_beforemail.py works without the need of the .sh however the idea is that
send_reminders and meeting_reminder.sh should work together.

To make this work, just need to run meeting_reminder.sh and is going to open a calendar window.

Select the date in the calendar, the meeting name and the email of the person it is going to be
sent to.

For the send_reminders_beforemail.py call the function 
./send_reminders.py "2025-07-25|Training Session|test@example.com,fake@test.org"
